Quantum Entanglement using Qiskit ⚛️

This project explores quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two qubits share a single combined state — changing one instantly affects the other.

🧠 Concept

Entanglement shows how quantum systems behave beyond classical logic. Two qubits can exist in linked states such as Bell pairs, where outcomes are perfectly correlated even when measured separately.

🔍 Objective

To understand how quantum correlation works and visualize how entangled qubits act as one system.

🧩 Process Overview

Create two qubits in a quantum circuit.

Apply a Hadamard gate to form superposition on the first qubit.

Use a CNOT gate to link the second qubit, creating entanglement.

Visualize the final joint state using Bloch spheres and measurement histograms.

📊 Observations

The two qubits no longer behave independently.

Measurement results always appear in pairs (00 or 11).

The system exhibits non-classical correlation, proving entanglement.

🚀 Outcome

Learned how two qubits can represent a single quantum system.

Understood Bell states and their importance in quantum communication.

Visualized the probabilistic nature of entangled measurements.
